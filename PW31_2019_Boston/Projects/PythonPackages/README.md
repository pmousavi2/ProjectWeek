# Project Description

This project will focus on improving the python package management in Slicer (i.e. pip install)

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

The objective is to have a consistent interface / process for installing patyhon packages across Slicer (extensions and in the pyton interactor)



## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->
1. Create a slicer.util.pip function (or equivalent architecture) for accessing pip install from scripts or the interactor
  * Investigate use of vitual environments in Slicer
2. Extension python package automatic install
  * Post-install packages using a hook for requirements.txt
 

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE. If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
